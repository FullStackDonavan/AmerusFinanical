            "A Self Funded, or Self-Insured plan, is one in which the employer assumes the financial risk for providing health care benefits to its employees. In practical terms, Self-Insured employers pay for claims out-of-pocket as they are presented instead of paying a pre-determined premium to an insurance carrier for a Fully Insured plan. Typically, a self-insured employer will set up a special trust fund to earmark money (corporate and employee contributions) to pay incurred claims. These plans are usually sold to large organizations that benefit from having enough insured to mitigate the financial risks associated with the plan.",

            "A level funded health plan (also known as a partially self-funded plan) is a type of health insurance plan that combines the cost savings and customization of self-funding with the financial safety and predictability of fully funded plans. These plans have become increasingly popular in recent years for small business owners who want the benefits of a self funded program without any of the risk. Small business owners have experienced huge savings compared to traditional fully insured plans.",
